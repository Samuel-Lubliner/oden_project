# Dynamic and user action pseudo-classes

These types of pseudo-classes can make your page feel much more dynamic and interactive.

`:focus` applies to an element that is currently selected by the user either through selecting it with their cursor or using their keyboard.

`:hover` will affect anything under the user’s mouse pointer. It can be used to give extra oomph to buttons and links to highlight that they’re interactable, or to trigger a drop-down menu.

`:active` applies to elements that are currently being clicked, and is especially useful for giving your user feedback that their action had an effect. This is a great one to give your buttons and other interactive elements more ‘tactile’ feedback.
