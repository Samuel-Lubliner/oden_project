# Frameworks

Frameworks are designed to abstract away the process of coding intuitive, reusable, and responsive elements. To use a framework, you need to understand how it expects you to structure your website and which classes it uses to apply its specific set of styles.

Bootstrap: heavy lifting of packaging up commonly used CSS code for you, even icons and interactions (like menu dropdowns).

Tailwind: Syntax supplying pre-named classes that typically only apply a single line of CSS each.

## Preprocessor

Tool used to extend the basic functionality of default vanilla CSS through its own scripting language.
