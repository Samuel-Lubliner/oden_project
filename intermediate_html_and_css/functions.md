# CSS functions

```css
color: rgb(0, 42, 255);
background: linear-gradient(90deg, blue, red);
```

linear-gradient generates a gradient image using the parameters it’s been given. It needs at least two color arguments: colors to transition between. Additionally, you can set the angle of direction of the gradient line (like we’ve done in the example), add more color values, etc.

CSS does not allow us to create our own functions.
