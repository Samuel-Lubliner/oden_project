## Style Guides

- The [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is one of the most popular. It is also very well formatted and easy to read.
- Google also has their own [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) for JavaScript.
- The [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html). Used by companies like NPM and GitHub, among others.

## Linting

Linters are tools that will scan your code with a set of style rules and will report any errors to you that they find. They can also be set to automatically fix some of the errors for you.

The industry standard for JavaScript is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
VS Code has an ESLint [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). Here is a [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linting-and-formatting-with-eslint-in-vs-code).
