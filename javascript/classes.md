# Classes

## Lesson Overview Summarization

### 1. Pros and Cons of Using Classes in JavaScript

- **Pros:** Simplifies syntax, familiarity for OO developers, cleaner code organization.
- **Cons:** Potentially misleading due to masking JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.

### 2. Differences from Java or Ruby Object Creation

- JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, in contrast to class-based inheritance in Java or Ruby.

### 3. Object Constructors vs. Classes

- Classes offer a streamlined syntax compared to traditional function-based object constructors, but are essentially special functions underneath.

### 4. Getters and Setters

- Special methods for controlled access to and modification of an object's properties.

### 5. Computed Names and Class Fields

- Computed names allow dynamic determination of property names. Class fields are direct properties of the class.

### 6. Private Class Fields and Methods

- Features for restricting access within the class, enhancing encapsulation and security.

### 7. Function Binding

- Necessary to maintain method context within the class when methods are passed around.

### 8. Inheritance with Classes

- Allows classes to extend other classes, inheriting properties and methods.

### 9. Composition over Inheritance

- Prefers combining objects to create complex ones over complex inheritance structures to avoid issues like tight coupling.

## Knowledge Check Answers

1. **Pros and Cons of Using Classes in JavaScript:** Covered in the overview.
2. **JavaScript’s Object Creation vs. Java/Ruby:** Prototype-based vs. class-based inheritance.
3. **Object Constructors vs. Classes:** Functional similarities with different syntax; classes are syntactic sugar.
4. **“Getters” & “Setters”:** Methods for controlled property interaction.
5. **Computed Names and Class Fields:** Dynamic property naming and direct class properties.
6. **Function Binding:** Ensures context maintenance for class methods.
7. **Static Properties:** Belong to the class, not instances, akin to Java's static methods.
8. **Private Class Features:** Provide encapsulation and security within classes.
9. **Inheritance with Classes:** Extension of classes to inherit features.
10. **Composition over Inheritance:** Design principle favoring simpler object combinations.
